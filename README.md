### Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence starts with zero and one, and then all subsequent numbers are the sum of the previous two.
```
0,1,0+1=1,1+1=2,1+2=3,2+3=5,3+5=8,5+8=13 etc
```
I created some JavaScript code that will calculate numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

I used test driven approach, starting with the simplest failing test.
